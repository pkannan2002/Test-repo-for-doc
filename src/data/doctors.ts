    story: `We often see doctors as professionals in white coats, diagnosing illnesses, prescribing medicines, and saving lives. But how often do we stop to think about the person behind that coat? The sacrifices, the emotional burden, and the unspoken struggles they endure every single day?

Recently, I had the privilege of speaking with Dr. Kannan Balaraman, a maxillofacial surgeon at Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore, whose words left a deep impact on me. His insights opened my eyes to the realities that doctors face—not just in their professional lives but in their personal lives as well.

The Unseen Struggles of Doctors

One of the things that struck me the most was how many people misunderstand the medical profession. Patients often think, “It’s just an hour’s work, why can’t the doctor just come and go?” But they fail to see the bigger picture. Imagine a doctor finishing a grueling night shift, only to be asked to continue working because another emergency has arrived. He is exhausted, frustrated, yet he continues—with passion, with dedication, and with the sheer will to save another life.

Yet, rather than gratitude, doctors sometimes face accusations, frustration, and even blame from patients and their families. The gap between doctors and the public isn’t created by medicine; it’s created by misunderstanding.

Success is Not Measured by Wealth

Dr. Balaraman said something that truly resonated with me: “A successful doctor doesn’t mean he is rich, and if he is rich, it doesn’t mean he is successful. A successful doctor is one who has saved lives and made an impact.” This profound statement challenges the common perception that financial success defines one's worth in any profession.

Doctors sacrifice their personal lives, working through sleepless nights, missing family gatherings, and carrying the weight of life-and-death decisions. Their success should not be measured by their bank balance but by the number of lives they’ve touched.

The Cost of Dedication

When I asked how being a doctor affects personal relationships, Dr. Balaraman sighed and said, “Most relatives don’t understand. They think we’re avoiding family responsibilities on purpose.”

Doctors miss birthdays, weddings, and even crucial moments in their own families' lives. Some relatives might understand, but many don’t. They assume that a doctor is choosing work over family when, in reality, they are choosing to save lives over their own comfort.

Senior doctors, he added, play a crucial role in guiding young medical professionals. A small mistake can cost a life, and that’s why constant supervision is necessary. It’s not just about studying medicine—it’s about relentless practice, real-time decision-making, and learning from experience.

The Mental and Emotional Burden

I was curious how he managed the stress of such a high-pressure job. His response was simple yet powerful: “Prayer.”

Before performing a critical surgery, before making a life-altering decision, he prays. Different doctors have different coping mechanisms—some spend time with friends, some engage in hobbies—but at the end of the day, every doctor carries the burden of responsibility. Every loss, every difficult decision, stays with them.

The Hardships of Medical Training

Doctors don’t become doctors overnight. It takes years—sometimes decades—of study, training, and sacrifice. Dr. Balaraman shared how, while his friends who pursued engineering settled into comfortable jobs with cars and houses, he was still studying, still training, still sacrificing.

Junior doctors in India, he pointed out, don’t receive enough support. Stipends are low, research opportunities are scarce, and they continue to struggle financially while dedicating their lives to learning how to save others. He expressed the need for better infrastructure, more research facilities, and higher stipends for junior doctors.

The Pandemic: A War for Doctors

When I asked about the COVID-19 pandemic, his response was chilling: “It was like a war. We couldn’t just walk away. Our families prayed every day for our safety, just like the families of soldiers on a battlefield.”

Doctors worked relentlessly, risking their lives, staying isolated from their own families to protect them. The stress, the fear, and the exhaustion were immeasurable. And yet, many faced backlash from the very people they were trying to save.

Doctors Are Humans Too

Perhaps the most important lesson from our conversation was this: Doctors are not just doctors. They are fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters. They have emotions, responsibilities, and personal lives. They prioritize people over paper—meaning their work is about saving lives, not making money.

But society often sees them differently, fueled by misinformation, unrealistic expectations, and a lack of understanding. Dr. Balaraman’s message to the public is simple: Respect doctors. See them as human beings. Understand their struggles. Don’t judge them based on viral social media posts or isolated incidents.

Beyond the White Coat

This conversation with Dr. Balaraman is just a beginning. There are countless stories like his—stories of sacrifice, dedication, and silent struggles. We, as a society, must change our perspective. We must recognize that doctors do more than wear white coats and prescribe medicine—they carry the weight of humanity’s health on their shoulders.

I thank Dr. Kannan Balaraman for taking the time to share his thoughts, despite his busy schedule. This is my small tribute to him and to every doctor who works beyond the white coat, beyond the expectations, and beyond the limits of human endurance.

To all the doctors out there—thank you. Your sacrifices do not go unnoticed.`,
